# Introduction to the Dataset
The space industry is known for being male dominated, starting from before the first *man* on the moon, and continuing with current-day pioneers like Elon Musk. While this may be due to space-related occupations being primarily populated by STEM graduates, a notoriously gender-imbalanced field, we couldn't help but note the surprising lack of female representation in space when skimming through the "astronauts" dataset that we found in the TidyTuesday database, despite the recent push for women in STEM fields. Is there a deeper-rooted, systemic problem with gender in space? We intend to find out!
-  Any other things to say regarding statements of the overall goal / research
However, in recent years the proportion of males to females has begun to equalise.

# Women in space

.pull-left[
- The first woman in space was Valentina Tereshkova in 1963, the next being 19 years later! Both were from the Soviet Union.
- While a number of American women successfully underwent the astronaut selection process in the early 1960s, they were not eligible to be astronauts; all astronauts were required to be military test pilots, a career not available to women at the time.
- NASA opened the space program to female applicants in 1978, in response to new anti-discrimination laws. When Sally Ride became the first female U.S. astronaut to go into space, the media asked her questions about her reproductive organs and whether she would cry if things went wrong on the job.

# Women in space


.pull-left[
- Material concerns may explain trends in EVA (spacewalk) time, for example; the low number of produced smaller sized space suits has been hindering women astronauts to do EVAs because of a lack of fitting suits.
- Due to the currently used risk models for endometrial, ovarian and breast cancer, women at NASA can currently only spend half as much time on missions as men, thereby limiting their career options compared to men, as both male and female astronauts are not allowed to accumulate a radiation dose that would increase their lifetime risk of developing fatal cancer by more than 3 percent. 
- NASA reports initially argued that menstruation could pose serious health risks or have a negative effect on performance, although it is now dealt with as a matter of routine.

# Comparing Gender with different variables

# Gender selection by Country and Programme
As we began to explore the data, we wondered if certain progressive countries led the introduction of women into the profession, or if all countries started to do so at the same time.
- We found that:
- As shown by the data, the first female astronauts were introduced in the ____ missions, ....
- variable "selection" is programme
- *graph*
- Look into the programme in which the astronauts are enrolled in? What is the ratio of males to females in each programme? What country are these programmes held in? Is there a country in particular which is more/less progressive in gender equality?
Adjusted R Squared Value? Is adding sex beneficial?


---

# Gender and Military Status/Occupation
- A common indicator of workplace gender inequality is women having to outperform their male counterparts to receive the same level of treatment, pay or respect.
- Aware of this, we sought to investigate how military status affected selection for missions, and if female astronauts needed to occupy a higher military rank to be considered than males.
- 
- Analyse the role of sex in relationship to military status. Are females of Military Status more likely to become astronauts? Or are more civilian females enlisted?
Adjusted R Squared Value? Is adding sex beneficial?
- Investigation the effect of gender and occupation. What ranking do female astronauts hold? How has this changed? Are higher ranking females more likely to be enlisted as astronauts?

#Mission Hours

.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE}
astronauts %>%
  filter(hours_mission > 500) %>%
ggplot(aes(y = hours_mission, x = sex)) +
  geom_violin()


```
]

.pull-right[
-As shown by the graphs once a women is selected they arent prejudiced in how long there mission are.

-This implies women are treated the same once employed and are are no more or less likely to get longer or shorter missions than men
]
---
#Recall for more missions
.pull-left[
```{r, echo = FALSE} 
astronauts %>%
ggplot(aes(x = total_number_of_missions, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```
]

.pull-right[
-While women are less likely to be selected for mission they are just as likely to be selected again for multiple mission once they have completed one.

-Also the probability of them being selected again as compared to men over more than 2 missions stays showing that they continue to do just as good job throughout all the missions they complete with no tail off.
]

.pull-center[
In conclusion  women are given the same mission hours and have the same likelihood to be recalled as men. This shows that while they are less likely to be selected in the first place they are treated the same once employed.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, we've found that ....
- Reasons/explainations for the trends we've been seeing - traditional gender roles - women in the house, men at work? Space being seen as dangerous? Men being seen as adventurers/pioneers, and not women?
- General trend: more women in space? Any predictions/projections for the future?

# Math Expressions

You can write LaTeX math expressions inside a pair of dollar signs, e.g. &#36;\alpha+\beta$ renders $\alpha+\beta$. You can use the display style with double dollar signs:

```
$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$
```

$$\bar{X}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^nX_i$$

Limitations:

1. The source code of a LaTeX math expression must be in one line, unless it is inside a pair of double dollar signs, in which case the starting `$$` must appear in the very beginning of a line, followed immediately by a non-space character, and the ending `$$` must be at the end of a line, led by a non-space character;

1. There should not be spaces after the opening `$` or before the closing `$`.

1. Math does not work on the title slide (see [#61](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan/issues/61) for a workaround).

# Feeling adventurous?

- Want to find out more about `xaringan`? See https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/#1.

- You are welcomed to use the default styling of the slides. In fact, that's what 
I expect majority of you will do. You will differentiate yourself with the content 
of your presentation.

- But some of you might want to play around with slide styling. The 
`xaringanthemer` provides some solutions for this that: https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanthemer/.
