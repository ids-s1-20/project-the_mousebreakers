# Introduction to the Dataset
The space industry is known for being male dominated, starting from before the first *man* on the moon, and continuing with current-day pioneers like Elon Musk. While this may be due to space-related occupations being primarily populated by STEM graduates, a notoriously gender-imbalanced field, we couldn't help but note the surprising lack of female representation in space when skimming through the "astronauts" dataset that we found in the TidyTuesday database, despite the recent push for women in STEM fields. Is there a deeper-rooted, systemic problem with gender in space? We intend to find out!
-  Any other things to say regarding statements of the overall goal / research
However, in recent years the proportion of males to females has begun to equalise.

- The first woman in space was Valentina Tereshkova in 1963, the next being 19 years later! Both were from the Soviet Union.
- While a number of American women successfully underwent the astronaut selection process in the early 1960s, they were not eligible to be astronauts; all astronauts were required to be military test pilots, a career not available to women at the time.
- NASA opened the space program to female applicants in 1978, in response to new anti-discrimination laws. When Sally Ride became the first female U.S. astronaut to go into space, the media asked her questions about her reproductive organs and whether she would cry if things went wrong on the job.

- Material concerns may explain trends in EVA (spacewalk) time, for example; the low number of produced smaller sized space suits has been hindering women astronauts to do EVAs because of a lack of fitting suits.
- Due to the currently used risk models for endometrial, ovarian and breast cancer, women at NASA can currently only spend half as much time on missions as men, thereby limiting their career options compared to men, as both male and female astronauts are not allowed to accumulate a radiation dose that would increase their lifetime risk of developing fatal cancer by more than 3 percent. 
- NASA reports initially argued that menstruation could pose serious health risks or have a negative effect on performance, although it is now dealt with as a matter of routine.

# Country and Programme

# Gender selection by Country and Programme
As we began to explore the data, we wondered if certain progressive countries led the introduction of women into the profession, or if all countries started to do so at the same time.
- We found that:
- As shown by the data, the first female astronauts were introduced in the ____ missions, ....
- variable "selection" is programme
- *graph*
- Look into the programme in which the astronauts are enrolled in? What is the ratio of males to females in each programme? What country are these programmes held in? Is there a country in particular which is more/less progressive in gender equality?
Adjusted R Squared Value? Is adding sex beneficial?

- Since 1959 people from 40 different nationalities have ventured into outer-space. 

- This includes countries you would expect such as the U.S. and Russia, as they are well known for their space programmes, but also lesser expectant countries such as Mongolia, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia. 

- Overall, the U.S. has the highest contribution  of astronauts at 854 followed by the U.S.S.R/Russia at 273. 

- However, following this is a significant decrease with 20 Japanese nationals entering outer space and only 18 Canadians

.pull-right[
- A higher proportion of all the astronauts are in the military (~60%).
- If we look at the genders of the astronauts separately, a much smaller proportion of women who were in space are in the military (~25%).
- Looking at only the male astronauts, we can see that they have higher than average proportion of astronauts with military status (~64%) and fewer civilians.


- While the number of civilian female astronauts has always been higher than the military affiliated ones, the difference between the two has been getting smaller.
- Both curves have a peak around the late 90's and have been decreasing ever since, but this is due to the decrease in the overall number of missions.

# Occupation

.pull-right[
- The two plots show a drastic difference between the occupation levels of the male and female astronauts.
- There are very few high ranking female astronauts, and most of them are mission specialists, meaning that they were selected for a specific mission, and usually are scientists, not part of the military.
- Male astronauts are more likely to be higher ranking, meaning that there are signs of gender inequality in the astronaut industry.

]
---

Even though the number of female commanders and pilots is close to zero, there is an upward trend in the selection of female flight engineers and a downward trend in mission specialists, meaning that women are likely not just being chosen for a mission in the recent years because they are experts in a specific scientific area, but their military experience is considered too.

.pull-right[
- As shown by the graphs once a women is selected they aren't prejudiced in how long there mission are shown by the similarties in shape.

- This implies women are treated the same once employed and are are no more or less likely to get longer or shorter missions than men.

- However for missions over 7500 hours women are not selected, however missions of this length make up only 10 of 1227 missions so appears to be statistically insignificant.

#Recall for more missions
.pull-left[
&lt;img src="presentation_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="80%" /&gt;
]

.pull-right[
- While women are less likely to be selected for mission they are just as likely to be selected again for multiple mission once they have completed one.

- Also the probability of them being selected again as compared to men over more than 2 missions stays showing that they continue to do just as good job throughout all the missions they complete with no tail off.
]

.pull-center[
In conclusion  women are given the same mission hours and have the same likelihood to be recalled as men. This shows that while they are less likely to be selected in the first place they are treated the same once employed.

- there is a relationship between covered variables and gender of the astronauts

- could be further explored and compared with different statistical models

# Conclusion

Upward trend in the number of women deployed in space missions. 
- changes in societal gender roles 
- striving for equality in the workplace
